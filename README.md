# Null Pointer Dereference in C
This repository demonstrates a common C programming error: dereferencing a null pointer.  The `bug.c` file contains the faulty code, which attempts to write to memory pointed to by a null pointer. This results in a segmentation fault (crash). The `bugSolution.c` provides a corrected version that addresses the issue.  Understanding and avoiding null pointer dereferences is crucial for writing robust and stable C programs.
